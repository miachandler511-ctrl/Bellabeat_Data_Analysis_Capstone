# 📈 Bellabeat Case Study: Optimizing User Engagement

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone.

The goal was to analyze smart device usage trends from the public **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** (via Kaggle) to identify strategic opportunities that could inform the marketing strategy for **Bellabeat**, a female-focused fitness technology company.

## 🎯 Key Findings & Business Recommendations

The analysis identified a critical gap in product utilization across different user segments.

**Summary of Recommendations:**
* **Target Active Users:** The most loyal, active users showed the highest day-to-day fluctuation in product engagement.
* **Feature Focus:** Recommend developing a **"gamified weekly challenge"** feature within the Bellabeat app to provide consistent motivation and drive daily utilization, particularly for the Active segment.
* **Marketing Focus:** Marketing campaigns should emphasize the **consistency and long-term benefits** of the product, not just initial fitness tracking.
